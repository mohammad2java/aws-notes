# üåê Amazon VPC Features

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) lets you launch AWS resources in a logically isolated network that you define.  
Below is a list of VPC features, why they are useful, and examples of how they are applied.

---

## üîë Core Features of VPC

| Feature | Why Use It | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Subnets** | Separate resources into **public** (internet-facing) and **private** (internal only) networks for security and better architecture design. | Web servers run in a **public subnet** while databases stay in a **private subnet** for isolation. |
| **Route Tables** | Control how traffic flows within the VPC, to the internet, or to other networks. | A route table sends all `0.0.0.0/0` traffic to the **Internet Gateway** for public internet access. |
| **Internet Gateway (IGW)** | Enables internet connectivity for resources in public subnets. | A web server in a public subnet uses IGW to serve content to global users. |
| **NAT Gateway / NAT Instance** | Lets private subnet resources access the internet **outbound** without exposing them to inbound internet traffic. | A database downloads OS patches via **NAT Gateway** without being exposed to the internet. |
| **Elastic IPs** | Provides a **static public IP** for resources, useful for whitelisting or external access. | Assign a fixed IP to a **bastion host** so administrators can always connect securely. |
| **VPC Peering** | Connects two VPCs privately over AWS‚Äôs backbone network. | A **Dev VPC** securely communicates with a **Prod VPC** without internet exposure. |
| **Transit Gateway** | Acts as a central hub to connect multiple VPCs and on-premises networks, simplifying complex topologies. | An enterprise with **10 VPCs** and **2 data centers** uses Transit Gateway for hub-and-spoke networking. |
| **VPC Endpoints (Interface/Gateway)** | Securely connect to AWS services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB) without using public internet. | An app in a private subnet retrieves images from **S3** via a VPC Gateway Endpoint. |
| **Security Groups (SGs)** | Instance-level firewalls that allow only required inbound/outbound traffic. | A DB SG allows connections **only from the App Server SG**, blocking everything else. |
| **Network ACLs (NACLs)** | Subnet-level firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic (stateless). | Block a known malicious IP range at the **subnet level** for added security. |
| **Flow Logs** | Capture IP traffic logs for troubleshooting, monitoring, and compliance. | Detect suspicious spikes in traffic by analyzing **VPC Flow Logs** in CloudWatch. |
| **Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)** | Attach multiple NICs to an EC2 instance for failover or network segregation. | A server has one ENI for **public traffic** and another for **internal-only communication**. |
| **DHCP Options Sets** | Customize DNS and DHCP settings for resources in the VPC. | Point instances to use **corporate DNS servers** instead of AWS defaults. |
| **VPN Connections** | Connect on-premises networks securely to AWS via encrypted IPsec tunnels. | A corporate office establishes a **VPN tunnel** to access workloads in AWS. |
| **AWS Direct Connect** | Provides private, low-latency, high-bandwidth dedicated links from data centers to AWS. | A **bank** uses Direct Connect for fast, secure connections to its AWS workloads. |
| **PrivateLink** | Access services in another VPC privately without internet or VPC peering. | A SaaS vendor exposes its service using **PrivateLink**, and customers consume it securely. |
| **IPv6 Support** | Provides scalable addressing for global applications and IoT. | A global e-commerce app uses **IPv6** to handle millions of devices worldwide. |
| **Carrier Gateway (CGW)** | Connect mobile networks (4G/5G) with AWS for telecom workloads. | A **5G IoT platform** connects mobile devices directly to AWS workloads via Carrier Gateway. |



# üîê AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) Features

AWS IAM helps you securely control access to AWS services and resources.  
You can manage **who** is authenticated (identity) and **what** they are authorized to do (permissions).

---

## üîë Core IAM Features

| Feature | Why Use It | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **IAM Users** | Represents individual people or applications needing access to AWS resources. Each user has credentials. | Create a user **developer1** with programmatic access keys for CLI use. |
| **IAM Groups** | Organize multiple users and attach permissions collectively instead of managing them individually. | Add all developers to a **Developers Group** that has EC2 read-only permissions. |
| **IAM Roles** | Provide temporary permissions to AWS resources without long-term credentials. | An **EC2 instance role** lets an app access S3 buckets without storing keys. |
| **Policies** | JSON documents that define permissions (allow/deny actions on resources). | Attach an **S3FullAccess policy** to a role so an app can manage S3 objects. |
| **Temporary Security Credentials (STS)** | Provide time-limited credentials for secure access. | A contractor gets **12-hour temporary credentials** to access a DynamoDB table. |
| **IAM Federation (SSO)** | Allow users to log in with corporate credentials or third-party identity providers (Google, AD, Okta). | Employees use their **company Active Directory** login to access AWS Console. |
| **Access Keys** | Programmatic credentials (ID + secret) for CLI/SDK/API access. | An automation script uses **access keys** to call AWS APIs. |
| **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** | Adds an extra layer of security beyond username/password. | Require admins to use **MFA tokens** when accessing the AWS Console. |
| **Service-Linked Roles** | Roles created automatically by AWS services to perform tasks on your behalf. | **CloudWatch** creates a service-linked role to push logs securely. |
| **Permissions Boundaries** | Limit the maximum permissions an IAM entity (user/role) can have. | A developer role has permissions, but the boundary prevents creating IAM users. |
| **Resource-Based Policies** | Policies attached directly to resources (like S3, SNS, SQS) for fine-grained control. | An **S3 bucket policy** allows access only from a specific VPC. |
| **Access Analyzer** | Helps identify resources shared publicly or with external accounts. | Detects that an **S3 bucket is accidentally public** and alerts admins. |
| **Credential Report & Access Advisor** | Provide visibility into user activity and unused permissions. | Identify IAM users with **unused keys** or roles that haven‚Äôt been used in 90 days. |
| **Identity Center (AWS SSO)** | Centralized single sign-on for multiple AWS accounts and applications. | A user logs in once and gets access to **multiple AWS accounts** via Identity Center. |
